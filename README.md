## Website for Svaštaonica Za Bebe

The Svaštaonica Za Bebe website is a small passion-driven project through which I expanded my knowledge of Vue.js and wanted to showcase my creativity. It was also created for the client's needs to showcase all their products in one place.

The website was built as a **Single Page Application**, using the latest **Vue.js 3** with the **Composition API** and **Bootstrap 5.0.2** for design.

The website design follows modern web design principles, such as font scaling, spacing between elements and texts, and various other aspects. It contains several interactive _hover_ effects that are not overly intrusive.

The website is responsive and adapted for both desktop and mobile devices.

The appearance resembles a personal web store with a touch of creativity and something new.

The website is hosted on **Netlify** and can be visited [through this link](https://svastaonicazabebe.netlify.app).
